# Requests for the tools track (APP), not numbered yet

**Owner:** tools track · **Status:** open (two waiting, 2026-10-25) · **Recorded by:** the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-07

The tools track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-APP-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The tools track turns each into a task and removes it from this file. The file is kept while empty because other issues link to it; a new request goes below this line.

Numbered on the tools branch (2026-10-09): clocks and the RTC (000-APP-0012), `log:` and `efivar` in the tools (211-APP-0013), full screen and the list of windows in `wm` (211-APP-0014), `update` (351-APP-0029), `wifi` (550-APP-0033), the audit's A07 and A08 (175-APP-0035, 175-APP-0036), the marked window (211-APP-0037), the message a program that ends at once leaves in its window (211-APP-0039), the shell's commands in `wm` (211-APP-0040), Russian speech on the MacBook Pro with the kernel track's measured note on its hiss and clicks (252-APP-0041) and `date set` (211-APP-0042). Numbered on 2026-10-10: the camera from `wm` and the shell in a window, as the camera from `wm` and `console` (158-APP-0043), the shell's own window (211-APP-0040) and `console` joined to the shell (211-APP-0044, waiting for `SLOT_SHELL` from `KRN`); the shell's window only when asked (211-APP-0045) and a window back to its content's size (211-APP-0046); later that day the menu's tests category (176-APP-0051), voice control as a service (000-APP-0052), what `hear` heard (000-APP-0053), the help keys in the shell's commands (000-APP-0054), the date and time from `wm`'s Settings (000-APP-0055), every menu entry reacting (000-APP-0056) and the machine's memory in `top` and `free` (211-APP-0057); then `cpus` naming AVX-512 and AMX (174-APP-0058); on 2026-10-12 the battery in `wm` and the shell (211-APP-0070); on 2026-10-14 the two races in the `wm` suite, a title written after adoption and Turn off's Enter (000-APP-0073), redirection and pipes in the shell and `msh` (000-APP-0074, its pipes waiting for 000-KRN-0094), and the shell's first frame in the system log (213-APP-0075); on 2026-10-15 the Wi-Fi country selector (550-APP-0082).

Numbered on 2026-10-22: `help <name>` reading the program from the booted slot, for 351-KRN-0151: [351-APP-0103](../issues-done/351-APP-0103-help-reads-the-booted-slots-program.done), done; the `wifi` guide naming the station's own join, for 550-NET-0041 (its request is on the kernel session's branch): [550-APP-0104](../issues-done/550-APP-0104-the-wifi-guide-names-the-stations-own-join.done), done once 550-NET-0041 was in `main`.

`wifi` following `idl/wifi.wit` 1.0 (the network track, 2026-10-12) was done in 550-APP-0033, and the note on the station's client in `SLOT_WIFI`, the read-only card client and the badged TLS client (550-KRN-0097, 000-KRN-0109) is taken up by 550-APP-0033, 000-APP-0049 and 351-APP-0083.

Notes read and kept as they are (the other tracks' changes stand, and the tools track words nothing otherwise):

- the shell's text for `loader.wit` 1.7 `unreadable` (211-KRN-0050): `CANNOT READ THE PROGRAM: ITS DISK DOES NOT ANSWER (UNPLUGGED?)`;
- the camera lent without a question (158; the maintainer's rule, 2026-10-09);
- the shell showing what a script prints at once (176-KRN-0087);
- a launch session holding every launch slot (000-KRN-0101);
- `check`, `bench` and `kbench` stopping when their console is gone (176-KRN-0103).

## The channel the updater holds, in `update status`, for 351-UPD-0025

Recorded by the update track (UPD), 2026-10-23.
- **What is new.** `idl/update.wit` 1.1 (in `main` f2f598b4) adds `metadata`: the channel the updater holds, its version, minimum and expiry, whether the expiry has passed, and whether it came from the source ([updater.md](../docs/update/updater.md), "Metadata past its expiry").
- **The request.** 351-APP-0029's `update status` shows it.
- **Why.** It would be the first program to call `metadata` on the platform, which [351-UPD-0025](../issues-done/351-UPD-0025-expiry-and-the-offline-policy.done)'s resolution names as left.

## `run` of an installed application's path, for 750-KRN-0169

Recorded by the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-25.
- **What is new.** The loader runs a program under `data/apps/` only as its signed package lists it, in the version `data/apps/<name>/current` names ([750-KRN-0169](../issues-done/750-KRN-0169-the-loader-checks-an-installed-application.done)). Its path is `data/apps/<name>/<file>` or `data/apps/<name>/<version>/<file>`, up to 63 bytes, as `loader.wit` takes (`string<64>`).
- **The request.** The shell's `run` takes a program name of at most `NAME_MAX` (16) bytes and says `PROGRAM NAME TOO LONG` past it (`shell/src/main.rs`, the `run` command), so `run data/apps/memtest/memtest.elf` is refused before the loader sees it. A name with a `/` in it could take up to 63 bytes, the loader's limit, while a bare name keeps 16.
- **Why.** Installed applications cannot be started from the shell by their real paths; the `modes` suite's check uses one-letter names to fit.

## Wi-Fi country and channel selector

Numbered on 2026-10-15 as [550-APP-0082](550-APP-0082-wifi-country-selector.md). Kept as a heading because other issues link to it.
