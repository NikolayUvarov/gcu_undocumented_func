# Requests for the tools track (APP), not numbered yet

**Owner:** tools track · **Status:** open · **Recorded by:** the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-07

The tools track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-APP-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The tools track turns each into a task and removes it from this file, and the file goes when it is empty.

## Clocks ask the RTC service 10 times a second

### Problem

`clock` calls `mind::rtc::seconds_since_midnight()` after every `wait_or_exit(100)`: 10 IPC calls a second per clock.

On x86 each answer is about 14 CMOS port accesses, each a system call. With 60 clocks that came to 8 700 port system calls a second. On aarch64 with 120 clocks, the RTC service's queue was full all the time. A `date` from the shell waited 8.5 s for a place (`000-KRN-0010` covers the kernel's side).

`sysmon` reads `STAT_TASKS` and `STAT_ENDPOINTS` every 100 ms. 171-KRN-0009 made both one pass, but they still cost about a millisecond each under the lock with 170 tasks.

### Plan (a proposal; the tools track decides)

- A clock could read the RTC once and count seconds from `CLOCK` (monotonic nanoseconds), reading the RTC again every minute or so.
- `sysmon` could sample endpoints less often than tasks.

### Acceptance criteria

The RTC service's load does not grow by 10 calls a second with each clock.

## `update` in the shell and `msh` (351, phase 2)

**Recorded by:** the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-08, for main task [351](351-self-update.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

The `updater` service ([351-UPD-0007](351-UPD-0007-updater-service.md)) will have an interface (`idl/update.wit`) but no command.

### Plan (a proposal; the tools track decides)

- `update check | fetch | apply | status | rollback` in the shell, and the same in `msh` under `requires: lifecycle`.
- `apply` asks for confirmation and names the versions.
- `status` shows the running, staged, trial and last-known-good versions and the last error.
- `sysmon` or `top` may show a staged update.

### Acceptance criteria

The commands drive the updater against the test server in QEMU, and the tools suite checks them.

## A Wi-Fi setup program (550)

**Recorded by:** the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-08, for main task [550](550-network-on-real-hardware.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

With the 802.11 station that the network track is asked for ([requests-NET.md](requests-NET.md)), the system could join a Wi-Fi network, but nothing lets a person choose one and type its passphrase.

### Plan (a proposal; the tools track decides)

- `wifi` (proposed name): a program in a `wm` window or on a full screen, and the same as shell commands. It:
  - lists the networks found with their name (SSID), signal, security (open, WPA2, WPA3, enterprise) and channel, and refreshes the list;
  - connects with a passphrase typed without echo;
  - offers to remember the passphrase, and stores it through `keystore`, never in a file;
  - shows the state (connecting; connected, with the address; failed, with the reason) and forgets a remembered network.
- It talks only to the station's Wi-Fi configuration interface. It never sees frames, or keys once the passphrase is handed over.

### Acceptance criteria

The tools suite checks the program against a station stand-in with fixed scan results (QEMU has no Wi-Fi). On the MacBook Pro, it lists the networks around and joins a WPA2-PSK one.
