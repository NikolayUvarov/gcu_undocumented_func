# Requests for the drivers track (DRV), not numbered yet

**Owner:** drivers track (the assessing session, `claude/ASR-DRV`, TRACKS 1.5) · **Status:** open · **Recorded by:** the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-09

The request on transfers to a gone device became [211-DRV-0021](211-DRV-0021-a-gone-device-fails-at-once.md) (2026-10-09).

The drivers track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-DRV-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The drivers track turns each into a task and removes it from this file, and the file goes when it is empty.

## The MacBook Pro's speakers: more of 551's step 2 if the GPIO is not enough (551)

**Recorded by:** the kernel track (KRN), 2026-10-09, for [551-DRV-0010](551-DRV-0010-hda-controller-and-codecs.md). That task stays with the kernel session until done (TRACKS 1.5).

The kernel session has set the Cirrus codec's amplifier GPIOs for Apple's machines (551-DRV-0010's progress) because the maintainer's run found `beep` and `say` silent. Jack detection, the internal microphone and any further codec setup are 551's step 2, which this track numbers when it takes it.
