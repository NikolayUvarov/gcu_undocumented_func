# Requests for the kernel track (KRN), not numbered yet

**Owner:** kernel track · **Status:** open (2 requests waiting, 2026-10-11; a drive that comes back checked to hold the same volumes became [000-KRN-0079](../issues-done/000-KRN-0079-a-returning-drive-is-checked-to-be-the-same-medium.done), the BCM4331's core stopped before its bus mastering became [550-KRN-0082](../issues-done/550-KRN-0082-the-bcm4331-core-stopped-before-its-bus-mastering.done), the badge right became [000-KRN-0073](../issues-done/000-KRN-0073-a-badge-set-only-with-the-right-to-set-it.done), the IDL fuzzer in CI became [000-KRN-0069](../issues-done/000-KRN-0069-the-idl-fuzzer-in-ci.done), bus mastering off at boot [550-KRN-0070](../issues-done/550-KRN-0070-bus-mastering-off-until-a-driver-has-the-device.done), blockstore's quota [251-KRN-0071](../issues-done/251-KRN-0071-a-memory-quota-for-blockstore.done), the FAT free count [251-KRN-0072](../issues-done/251-KRN-0072-free-clusters-counted-a-fat-sector-at-a-time.done); QEMU's vvfat crash in the aarch64 boot suite is [000-KRN-0067](000-KRN-0067-the-aarch64-boot-test-on-pcu.md))

The kernel track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-KRN-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The kernel track turns each into a task and removes it from this file. The file is kept while empty because other issues link to it; a new request goes below this line.

## A client of the updater for the shell

**Recorded by:** the update track (`UPD`), 2026-10-10, for [351-UPD-0007](../issues-done/351-UPD-0007-updater-service.done) and the tools track's `update` command (351-APP-0029, on its branch).

### Problem

`updater` serves `idl/update.wit` 1.0 (`check`, `fetch`, `apply`, `rollback`, `status`), but no task holds a client of it: it acts only through the automatic policy in `update.txt`. The shell's static slots 1 to 31 are all named in `common/abi.rs` (`SLOT_DYNAMIC` is 32), so a slot for the client is an ABI question.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- A slot for the shell's client of `updater`, or another way for the shell to hold one.
- `init` gives the shell an unbadged client (the updater checks no badge: every request ends in a check of signed releases, and `apply` and `rollback` ask the user through the shell's command).
- The shell lends it to programs that ask for it, if the tools track wants `update` in `msh`.

### Acceptance criteria

The shell holds a client of `updater` (`caps` shows it), and `status` answers through it.

## init says whether it confirmed a trial boot

**Recorded by:** the update track (`UPD`), 2026-10-10, for [351-UPD-0007](../issues-done/351-UPD-0007-updater-service.done).

### Problem

`init` confirms a healthy trial boot to the kernel (`BOOT_CONFIRM`, 351-KRN-0014), and the confirmed boot record is the updater's to write. The updater cannot ask whether the boot was confirmed. It waits until 5 s past the kernel's deadline (120 s): had the boot not been confirmed, the kernel would have restarted the machine by then. That is sound but slow. The other slot stays untouched for two minutes after every update, and the QEMU `update` check waits that long.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- `init.wit` 1.4: `boot: func() -> result<boot, error>`, with the slot, whether it booted on trial and whether `init` confirmed it. Any client of `init` may call it, or only the `BADGE_REBOOT` one.
- The updater asks for it every second while it waits, and keeps the deadline as the bound.

### Acceptance criteria

On a trial boot, the updater writes the confirmed record within a few seconds of `[INIT] TRIAL BOOT CONFIRMED`, and the `update` check passes.
