# Requests for the kernel track (KRN), not numbered yet

**Owner:** kernel track · **Status:** open (5 requests waiting, 2026-10-10; the IDL fuzzer, bus mastering at boot, blockstore's quota and the FAT free count became 000-KRN-0069 to 251-KRN-0072; QEMU's vvfat crash is 000-KRN-0067)

The kernel track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-KRN-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The kernel track turns each into a task and removes it from this file. The file is kept while empty because other issues link to it; a new request goes below this line.

## A launch session holds as many grants as there are launch slots (211-APP-0044)

**Recorded by:** the tools track (APP), 2026-10-10, for [211-APP-0044](../issues-done/211-APP-0044-console-joined-to-the-shell.done).

### Problem

`loader`'s launch session keeps at most 5 grants (`Session.grants: [(u8, usize); 5]` in `loader/src/main.rs`). A sixth `grant` is refused with `limit`. `LAUNCH_SLOTS` (211-KRN-0058) names 16 slots a launcher may fill.

`console` started by `wm` now asks for the shell's commands too, so it may need six grants:

- the window;
- the user's files;
- system information;
- the camera;
- the shell's commands (`SLOT_SHELL`);
- for `record -w`, the window to see.

The `wm` suite's `record -w` lost its window lease to the limit. The tools track now grants `SLOT_SHELL` last and lets a start go on without it (wm and the shell), so the program runs without the shell's commands when the session is full.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- **The session's array** holds `LAUNCH_SLOTS.len()` grants, or `SPAWN_GRANTS_MAX` less the loader's own.
- **A refused grant** still answers `limit`.

### Acceptance criteria

A launcher grants each of `LAUNCH_SLOTS` in one session and the program holds them all. `console` from `wm` gets the shell's commands beside the window lease of `record -w`.

## A console program ends when its console is gone (000-APP-0056)

**Recorded by:** the tools track (`APP`), 2026-10-10, from the walk through wm's menu in [000-APP-0056](../issues-done/000-APP-0056-every-entry-of-wms-menu-reacts.done).

### Problem

wm's menu has a category "Tests and performance": `check`, `bench` and `kbench` run there in a `console` window. Closing that window ends `console`, but not the program it ran:

- `mind::output::send` stops sending when the launcher's endpoint answers `Peer`, and the program goes on.
- A full `kbench` or `bench` then measures for minutes with nobody watching it, and takes processor time from whatever the user does next.
- `console` cannot end its programs. Ending another program is the shell's (process control), and the shell asks the user first.

000-APP-0056 asks that nothing started from the menu runs unseen. Until this is settled, the wm suite waits for these three to end before it closes their window (`RUN_TO_END` in `tests/qemu_smoke.py`).

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

One of these:

- **In libmind.** A program whose launcher's endpoint is gone ends at its next output, with a nonzero status, as a Unix program does on a hang-up. A program that must outlive its console (none is known) could opt out.
- **In the three tools.** libmind says whether the output still reaches the launcher (`mind::output::open()`). `check`, `bench` and `kbench` look at it between rows, write the log they have, and say in it that they stopped because their console closed.

### Acceptance criteria

In QEMU, `kbench` started from wm's menu ends within one row after its window is closed, and the kernel's log shows it. The wm suite's walk then closes the window without waiting, and `RUN_TO_END` is empty.

## A badge set only by a holder with the right to set it

**Recorded by:** the update track (`UPD`), 2026-10-10, from [351-KRN-0022](../issues-done/351-KRN-0022-updater-grants.done) and [351-UPD-0008](../issues-done/351-UPD-0008-update-zone-in-vfs.done).

### Problem

`CAP_MINT` sets a badge on any unbadged endpoint capability, whoever holds it (`mint` in `kernel/src/scheduler.rs`, MC-3.4). A server that grants authority by badge is therefore only as safe as `init`'s care never to hand out an unbadged client of it: 351-KRN-0022 badged the clients of `init` and `vfs_server` one by one (`BADGE_LIFECYCLE`, `BADGE_READER`) for this reason. Every other badge-checking server depends on the same care, and a new grant can break it silently. Which clients are unbadged today was sent to the maintainer and the kernel session privately, as [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) asks.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- A right on endpoint capabilities, for example `CAP_BADGE`, that `CAP_MINT` requires to set a badge. A child never carries it unless the mask keeps it, and a badged child never does.
- `init` keeps it on the clients it badges from, and every capability it hands out lacks it.
- A new ABI version and an explicit transition (MC-12.4, 12.7).

### Acceptance criteria

A new `isolation` case: a program holding an unbadged client without the right gets `ERR_INVALID` when it sets a badge, and the suites pass as before.

## A client of the updater for the shell

**Recorded by:** the update track (`UPD`), 2026-10-10, for [351-UPD-0007](351-UPD-0007-updater-service.md) and the tools track's `update` command ([requests-APP.md](requests-APP.md)).

### Problem

`updater` serves `idl/update.wit` 1.0 (`check`, `fetch`, `apply`, `rollback`, `status`), but no task holds a client of it: it acts only through the automatic policy in `update.txt`. The shell's static slots 1 to 31 are all named in `common/abi.rs` (`SLOT_DYNAMIC` is 32), so a slot for the client is an ABI question.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- A slot for the shell's client of `updater`, or another way for the shell to hold one.
- `init` gives the shell an unbadged client (the updater checks no badge: every request ends in a check of signed releases, and `apply` and `rollback` ask the user through the shell's command).
- The shell lends it to programs that ask for it, if the tools track wants `update` in `msh`.

### Acceptance criteria

The shell holds a client of `updater` (`caps` shows it), and `status` answers through it.

## init says whether it confirmed a trial boot

**Recorded by:** the update track (`UPD`), 2026-10-10, for [351-UPD-0007](351-UPD-0007-updater-service.md).

### Problem

`init` confirms a healthy trial boot to the kernel (`BOOT_CONFIRM`, 351-KRN-0014), and the confirmed boot record is the updater's to write. The updater cannot ask whether the boot was confirmed. It waits until 5 s past the kernel's deadline (120 s): had the boot not been confirmed, the kernel would have restarted the machine by then. That is sound but slow. The other slot stays untouched for two minutes after every update, and the QEMU `update` check waits that long.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- `init.wit` 1.4: `boot: func() -> result<boot, error>`, with the slot, whether it booted on trial and whether `init` confirmed it. Any client of `init` may call it, or only the `BADGE_REBOOT` one.
- The updater asks for it every second while it waits, and keeps the deadline as the bound.

### Acceptance criteria

On a trial boot, the updater writes the confirmed record within a few seconds of `[INIT] TRIAL BOOT CONFIRMED`, and the `update` check passes.
