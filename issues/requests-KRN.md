# Requests for the kernel track (KRN), not numbered yet

**Owner:** kernel track · **Status:** open (2 requests waiting, 2026-10-10; the TPM's registers became [351-KRN-0052](351-KRN-0052-tpm-registers-from-the-firmware.md), `bcm_wifi` as a boot service [550-KRN-0059](550-KRN-0059-bcm-wifi-at-boot.md), and the tools track's `SLOT_SHELL` and `SLOT_CLIPBOARD` from its branch [211-KRN-0058](211-KRN-0058-slots-for-the-shell-and-the-clipboard.md)) · **Recorded by:** the tools track (APP), 2026-10-06

The kernel track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-KRN-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The kernel track turns each into a task and removes it from this file. The file is kept while empty because other issues link to it; a new request goes below this line.

## The IDL fuzzer in CI's host tests (500-ASR-0001)

**Recorded by:** the assurance track (`ASR`), 2026-10-09, for [500-ASR-0001](500-ASR-0001-idl-decoder-fuzzing.md).

### Problem

`tests/idl_fuzz_host.rs` fuzzes every generated IDL decoder with a fixed seed: 24 receivers and 82 types, 50 000 inputs per target, about 4 s. It is not in CI's host tests yet, and the CI files are the kernel track's.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- Add `idl_fuzz` to the list of host tests in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the step "Host tests") and in `scripts/ci_local.sh` (`host_tests`), built like the others: `rustc --edition=2021 --test tests/idl_fuzz_host.rs`.
- If 175-KRN-0046 changes how the host tests fail, the line follows that.

### Acceptance criteria

CI runs the test on every push, and a finding fails the host-test step.

## The pinned toolchain installed once before the parallel build (000-KRN-0020)

**Recorded by:** the assurance and drivers session (`ASR`, `DRV`), 2026-10-09, after the maintainer's build of `fast-test` failed.

### Problem

`rust-toolchain.toml` gained `components = ["rust-src"]` (e5a34c2, 250-APP-0020). On a machine with `nightly-2026-10-02` but without that component, `02_build.sh` starts every crate's cargo at once (000-KRN-0020). Each cargo asks rustup to add `rust-src`, and the downloads race on one file:

```
error: component download failed for rust-src: could not rename 'downloaded' file from
'~/.rustup/downloads/7da4d…partial' to '…': No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

All 70 crates fail, and the build reports them as failures of the code. A single `rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2026-10-02` fixed it.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- Before the parallel step, `02_build.sh` runs `rustup toolchain install` once in the repository. It reads `rust-toolchain.toml` and installs the channel, the components and the targets. A failure stops the build with that message.
- `01_prepare_env.sh` does the same, so the two cannot disagree.

### Acceptance criteria

On a machine whose rustup lacks a component the toolchain file names, `02_build.sh` installs it once and the build succeeds. A failed install is reported as such, not as 70 failed crates.
