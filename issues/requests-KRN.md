# Requests for the kernel track (KRN), not numbered yet

**Owner:** kernel track · **Status:** open (4 requests waiting: the TPM's registers; three for 700, 2026-10-09) · **Recorded by:** the tools track (APP), 2026-10-06

The kernel track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-KRN-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The kernel track turns each into a task and removes it from this file. The file is kept while empty because other issues link to it; a new request goes below this line.

## The TPM's registers from the firmware's tables (`PLATFORM_TPM`)

**Recorded by:** the network and drivers tracks (the storage session), 2026-10-09, for [351-DRV-0015](351-DRV-0015-tpm-driver.md) and [351-NET-0006](351-NET-0006-device-key-sealed-by-a-tpm.md).

### Problem

The TPM service `tpm` drives a TPM 2.0 and `keystore` seals the device key with it. Both are built and host-tested, and so is `init`'s part ([351-KRN-0043](../issues-done/351-KRN-0043-tpm-service-at-boot.done)): it starts `tpm` with `PLATFORM_MMIO, PLATFORM_TPM` (`common/abi.rs`, 0x30) in its slot 2.

But `platform::mmio(PLATFORM_TPM)` answers `NOT_FOUND` on both architectures, because the kernel does not read the TPM's place from the firmware. So `tpm` reports no TPM, and the key stays unencrypted (the interim).

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel and porting tracks decide)

- **x86** (`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/acpi.rs`, `platform.rs`): read the ACPI `TPM2` table: the control area's address at 40, the start method at 48.
  - A CRB (7) has locality 0's registers in the control area's page. QEMU's `tpm-crb` puts the area at 0xFED40040.
  - A FIFO (6) is at the PC Client profile's 0xFED40000.
  - Hand out 4 KiB. Other start methods are not driven.
- **aarch64** (`acpi.rs`, `aml.rs`, `board.rs`, `platform.rs`): QEMU's `tpm-tis-device` is a DSDT device `MSFT0101` whose static `_CRS` holds a `Memory32Fixed` window (0x5000). The pin controllers' scan in `aml.rs` finds it once it takes the ID; hand out the window's first 4 KiB. A `TPM2` table with a CRB (7) as on x86.
- **Tests:**
  - `tests/aml_host.rs`: the `MSFT0101` device beside a PL061.
  - `tpm_check` in the `tls` suite (both architectures, `swtpm`) checks the sealing once this lands. Until then it skips that part and says why; remove the skip with this task.

A sketch of all of it, about 70 lines, was run by the storage session on its machine: the whole chain (seal, a reboot, unseal, another TPM refused) passed on x86 with `tpm-crb` and on aarch64 with `tpm-tis-device`. It is not committed, because `kernel/src/arch/` is the porting track's. The storage session can send it on request.

### Acceptance criteria

- With `-device tpm-crb` (x86) or `-device tpm-tis-device` (aarch64) and `swtpm`, `init` hands `tpm` the registers and `tpm` logs `READY`.
- Without a TPM, `PLATFORM_TPM` answers `NOT_FOUND` as now.

## Boot images and `init`'s grants for `effector` and `effector_gw` (700)

**Recorded by:** the Effector agent track (EFF), 2026-10-09, for main task [700](700-effector-agent.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

The Effector agent is two boot services:
- `effector` speaks to the server and parses its input;
- `effector_gw` acts on the machine within the owner's policy (MC-11.11).

The list of boot images is part of the ABI, and each service's grants are an arm of `Init::start`.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- Two boot images in `common/abi.rs` (`BOOT_IMAGES`, `BOOT_SERVICES`), with the build, the signed manifest and the suites' service list.
- Both are off unless the owner enables them in `data/services.txt` (173-KRN-0035).
- **`effector` gets:**
  - `rtc`;
  - `tls` (`SLOT_TLS`);
  - a `parse` client (`SLOT_PARSE`, 109);
  - the `netpolicy` flow for program `effector` (renewable, when `NET` adds that);
  - a read-only `vfs` client scoped to `data/effector/`;
  - its own private directory `system/effector` for the token, as 351-KRN-0040 gives `keystore` its own;
  - an endpoint to `effector_gw`.
  - Nothing else.
- **`effector_gw` gets:**
  - a lifecycle client (the request below);
  - the log read badge;
  - `sysinfo`;
  - a writable `vfs` client scoped to `data/effector/` and `data/apps/` (the request below);
  - read-only clients for `log:` and the file roots;
  - a client of `updater` (requests-UPD);
  - an `init` client badged `BADGE_REBOOT`;
  - its own private directory `system/effector_gw` for the command journal;
  - screen capture, for the policy's `screenshot`.
  - No `tls`, no flow, no `parse` client, no device key. The test account's spawn rights are 501's, requested when 501-ASR-0009 starts.
- **The ABI change** goes with `libmind`, `docs/api` and the `isolation` suite, as AGENTS.md says.

### Acceptance criteria

In QEMU, with both enabled, each service holds exactly the listed grants (the `isolation` suite's checks). With them disabled, neither starts.

## A writable `vfs` client scoped to a service's directories (700)

**Recorded by:** the Effector agent track (EFF), 2026-10-09, for main task [700](700-effector-agent.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

`vfs_server` lets only the shell's `BADGE_USER` client write, and services get read-only clients. The Effector gateway must write:
- its audit trail, which the owner reads;
- delivered files;
- installed applications, which the loader must be able to read.

It must not be able to write anywhere else on `data/`. A private directory in `system/` (351-KRN-0040, 108-KRN-0041) covers the journal, but not these: other programs, the shell and the loader must read them.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track, or the track that owns `vfs_server`, decides)

- A write grant limited to named directories, made by `init` from the service's arm (or `vfs.wit`'s `scope` applied to writes).
- Rename within the scope, and flush.
- A path outside the scope is refused with the same error as a missing file.

### Acceptance criteria

A service with a scoped write client creates, renames and flushes files under its directories, and is refused everywhere else, in a new `isolation` case.

## A lifecycle client limited to named services (700)

**Recorded by:** the Effector agent track (EFF), 2026-10-09, for main task [700](700-effector-agent.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

`init`'s lifecycle client (`BADGE_LIFECYCLE`) may start, stop and restart every boot service. The Effector gateway needs that for the few services the owner names in its policy. Holding the whole authority would make it a broad retained authority that needs a justification (MC-3.7). An attenuated grant is the better answer (MC-3.4).

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- `init` gives the gateway a lifecycle client that serves `run`, `stop` and `restart` only for the boot services in a set:
  - fixed in the gateway's arm; or
  - read by `init` from the owner's configuration (173).
- `list` is allowed. `stop-task`, `reboot` and the services `init`, `shell`, `effector` and `effector_gw` are always refused.

### Acceptance criteria

In the `isolation` suite, the gateway's client restarts a service in its set and is refused for one outside it, for `init` and for itself.
