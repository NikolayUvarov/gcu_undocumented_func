# Requests for the kernel track (KRN), not numbered yet

**Owner:** kernel track · **Status:** open (three requests for 700, 2026-10-09) · **Recorded by:** the tools track (APP), 2026-10-06

The kernel track numbers its own tasks (`NNN-KRN-MMMM`), so requests from other tracks wait here. The kernel track turns each into a task and removes it from this file. The file is kept while empty because other issues link to it; a new request goes below this line.

## Boot images and `init`'s grants for `effector` and `effector_gw` (700)

**Recorded by:** the Effector agent track (EFF), 2026-10-09, for main task [700](700-effector-agent.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

The Effector agent is two boot services:
- `effector` speaks to the server and parses its input;
- `effector_gw` acts on the machine within the owner's policy (MC-11.11).

The list of boot images is part of the ABI, and each service's grants are an arm of `Init::start`.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- Two boot images in `common/abi.rs` (`BOOT_IMAGES`, `BOOT_SERVICES`), with the build, the signed manifest and the suites' service list.
- Both are off unless the owner enables them in `data/services.txt` (173-KRN-0035).
- **`effector` gets:**
  - `rtc`;
  - `tls` (`SLOT_TLS`);
  - a `parse` client (`SLOT_PARSE`, 109);
  - the `netpolicy` flow for program `effector` (renewable, when `NET` adds that);
  - a read-only `vfs` client scoped to `data/effector/`;
  - its own private directory `system/effector` for the token, as 351-KRN-0040 gives `keystore` its own;
  - an endpoint to `effector_gw`.
  - Nothing else.
- **`effector_gw` gets:**
  - a lifecycle client (the request below);
  - the log read badge;
  - `sysinfo`;
  - a writable `vfs` client scoped to `data/effector/` and `data/apps/` (the request below);
  - read-only clients for `log:` and the file roots;
  - a client of `updater` (requests-UPD);
  - an `init` client badged `BADGE_REBOOT`;
  - its own private directory `system/effector_gw` for the command journal;
  - screen capture, for the policy's `screenshot`.
  - No `tls`, no flow, no `parse` client, no device key. The test account's spawn rights are 501's, requested when 501-ASR-0009 starts.
- **The ABI change** goes with `libmind`, `docs/api` and the `isolation` suite, as AGENTS.md says.

### Acceptance criteria

In QEMU, with both enabled, each service holds exactly the listed grants (the `isolation` suite's checks). With them disabled, neither starts.

## A writable `vfs` client scoped to a service's directories (700)

**Recorded by:** the Effector agent track (EFF), 2026-10-09, for main task [700](700-effector-agent.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

`vfs_server` lets only the shell's `BADGE_USER` client write, and services get read-only clients. The Effector gateway must write:
- its audit trail, which the owner reads;
- delivered files;
- installed applications, which the loader must be able to read.

It must not be able to write anywhere else on `data/`. A private directory in `system/` (351-KRN-0040, 108-KRN-0041) covers the journal, but not these: other programs, the shell and the loader must read them.

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track, or the track that owns `vfs_server`, decides)

- A write grant limited to named directories, made by `init` from the service's arm (or `vfs.wit`'s `scope` applied to writes).
- Rename within the scope, and flush.
- A path outside the scope is refused with the same error as a missing file.

### Acceptance criteria

A service with a scoped write client creates, renames and flushes files under its directories, and is refused everywhere else, in a new `isolation` case.

## A lifecycle client limited to named services (700)

**Recorded by:** the Effector agent track (EFF), 2026-10-09, for main task [700](700-effector-agent.md) at the maintainer's request.

### Problem

`init`'s lifecycle client (`BADGE_LIFECYCLE`) may start, stop and restart every boot service. The Effector gateway needs that for the few services the owner names in its policy. Holding the whole authority would make it a broad retained authority that needs a justification (MC-3.7). An attenuated grant is the better answer (MC-3.4).

### Plan (a proposal; the kernel track decides)

- `init` gives the gateway a lifecycle client that serves `run`, `stop` and `restart` only for the boot services in a set:
  - fixed in the gateway's arm; or
  - read by `init` from the owner's configuration (173).
- `list` is allowed. `stop-task`, `reboot` and the services `init`, `shell`, `effector` and `effector_gw` are always refused.

### Acceptance criteria

In the `isolation` suite, the gateway's client restarts a service in its set and is refused for one outside it, for `init` and for itself.
