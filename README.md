# MIND CORE

Iain M. Banks supposed The Minds of the Culture's spaceships — the ultra-powerful AIs controlling General Contact Units and Orbitals — must reside somewhere. No matter how multidimensional and advanced their hardware substrate may be, at a fundamental level, any computing architecture needs two basic things to wake up and become self-aware: a bootloader and an operating system.

Before a Mind can simulate pocket universes, juggle hyperspace vectors, or conduct delicate diplomatic games on behalf of an entire civilization, it requires a reliable and predictable foundation. It is time to start building it.

This repository is the first step toward creating a substrate-independent environment for future Minds. We are starting right now, from the very lowest level of hardware reality.

### Goals and Architecture

* **Substrate Initialization (Bootloader):** Direct interaction with UEFI, seizing control of the bare metal, and preparing physical memory.
* **Kernel:** The basic reality dispatcher. Handling hardware interrupts, system calls, and preemptive multitasking.
* **Isolated Environment (Userspace):** A space for the genesis and parallel execution of high-level processes and future cognitive functions.

Every Mind needs its first processor tick. We are providing exactly that.
